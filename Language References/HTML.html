      <p>
        An asexual person does not experience sexual attraction â€“ they are not
        drawn to people sexually and do not desire to act upon attraction to
        others in a sexual way. Unlike celibacy, which is a choice to abstain
        from sexual activity, asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are,
        just like other sexual orientations. Asexuality does not make our lives
        any worse or better; we just face a different set of needs and
        challenges than most sexual people do. There is considerable diversity
        among the asexual community in the needs and experiences often
        associated with sexuality including relationships, attraction, and
        arousal.
